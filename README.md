## Overview

The project consists of two primary functionalities:
1. **QR Code Generation**: Generates a QR code from a public URL of a PDF file.
2. **Email Sending**: Sends an email with the generated QR code attached using SMTP.

An optional `main.py` script can orchestrate these tasks, providing a single entry point to run the entire workflow.

## Features

- **QR Code Generation**: Uses the `qrcode` Python library to convert a PDF URL into a QR code image (`cv_qr.png`).
- **Email Sending**: Uses Pythonâ€™s `smtplib` to send an email with the QR code as an attachment.
- **Configuration via Environment Variables**: Credentials and configuration details are stored in a `.env` file for security and flexibility.
- **Modular Design**: Separate scripts for QR code generation and email sending, with an optional main script to run them sequentially.
